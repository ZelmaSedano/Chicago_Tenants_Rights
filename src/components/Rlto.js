              Say whatcha will about Chicago - brutal winters, the worst
              gridlock in the United States of America - our city leaders have,
              for decades, carefully placed protections for both tenants and
              landlords. The Residential Landlord Tenant Ordinance - our 'Bible'
              here at CTRL - is your best friend if you are a tenant or even if
              you're a new landlord.{' '}
              <span>
                You should know that your landlord is required by law to attach
                a summary of your rights under the RLTO to your lease agreement.

              Below are helpful snippets of the RLTO for your review - call us
              or email us if you have any questions. We're happy to help.

              <span>PURPOSE OF RLTO:</span> Section 5-12-010 "...It is the
              purpose of this chapter and the policy of the city, in order to
              protect and promote the public health, safety and welfare of its
              citizens, to establish the rights and obligations of the landlord
              and the tenant in the rental of dwelling units, and to encourage
              the landlord and the tenant to maintain and improve the quality of
              housing....This chapter applies to, regulates and determines
              rights, obligations and remedies under every rental agreement for
              a dwelling unit located within the City of Chicago , regardless of
              where the agreement is made.

                LANDLORD'S RIGHT OF ACCESS: Did your landlord enter your
                apartment without permission? If your landlord wants to enter
                your unit, they must give you 48 hours' notice as specified in
                Section 5-12-050:
              </span>{' '}
              "A tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord
              to enter the dwelling unit: a) to make necessary or agreed
              repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements; b) to supply
              necessary or agreed services; c) to conduct inspections authorized
              or required by any government agency; d) to exhibit the dwelling
              unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortagees, workmen or
              contractors; e) to exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective
              tenants 60 days or less prior to the expiration of the existing
              rental agreement; f) for practical necessity where repairs or
              maintenance elsewhere in the building unexpectedly require such
              access; g) to determine a tenant's compliance with provisions in
              the rental agreement; and (h) in case of emergency.{' '}
              <span>
                The landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to
                harass the tenant.
              </span>{' '}
              Except in cases where access is authorized by subsection (f) or
              (h) of this section,{' '}
              <span>
                the landlord shall give the tenant notice of the landlord's
                intent to enter of no less than two days.
              </span>{' '}
              Such notice shall be provided directly to each dwelling unit by
              mail, telephone, written notice to the dwelling unit, or by other
              reasonable means designed in good faith to provide notice to the
              tenant...In cases where access is authorized by subsection (f) or
              (h) of this section, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit
              without notice or consent of the tenant. The landlord shall give
              the tenant notice of such entry within two days after such entry."
              The RLTO provides mo(netary remedies if your landlord violated
              this - you could be entitled to recover "an amount equal to not
              more than one month's rent or twice the damage sustained by
              [them], whichever is greater."

              <span>SECURITY DEPOSITS:</span> Section 5-12-080 (a)(1){' '}
              <span>
                A landlord shall hold all security deposits received by him in a
                federally insured interest-bearing account in a bank, savings,
                and loan association or other financial institution located in
                the State of Illinois.
              </span>{' '}
              A security deposit and interest due thereon shall continue to be
              the property of the tenant making such deposit, shall not be
              commingled with the assets of the landlord, and shall not be
              subject to the claims of any creditor of the landlord or of the
              landlord's successors in interest, including a foreclosing
              mortgagee or trustee in bankruptcy. (2) Notwithstanding subsection
              (a)(1), a landlord may accept the payment of the first month's
              rent and security deposit in one check or one electronic funds
              transfer, and deposit the check or electronic funds transfer into
              one account. If within 5 business days of the acceptance of the
              check or transfer, the landlord transfers the amount of the
              security deposit into a separate account that complies with
              subsection (a)(1). (3){' '}
              <span>
                The name and address of the financial institution where the

                conspicuously disclosed in the written rental agreement signed
                by the tenant.
              </span>{' '}
              If no written rental agreement is provided, the landlord shall
              within 14 days of receipt of the security deposit, notify the
              tenant in writing of the name and address of the financial
              institution where the security deposit was deposited....(b)(1)
              Except as provided for in subsection (b)(2),{' '}
              <span>
                any landlord who receives a security deposit from a tenant or
                prospective tenant shall give said tenant or prospective tenant
                at the time of receiving such security deposit
              </span>{' '}
              a receipt indicating the amount of such security deposit, the name
              of the person receiving it, and in the case of the agent, the name
              of the landlord for whom such security deposit is received. (c) A
              landlord who holds a security deposit or prepaid rent pursuant to
              this section for more than six months shall pay interest to the
              tenant accruing from the beginning date of the rental term
              specified in the rental agreement at the rate determined in
              accordance with Section 5-12-081 for the year in which the rental
              agreement was entered into.{' '}
              <span>
                The landlord shall, within 30 days after the end of each
                12-month rental period, pay to the tenant any interest, by cash
                or credit to be applied to the rent due. (d) The landlord shall,
                within 45 days after the date that the tenant vacates the
                dwelling unit or within seven days after the date that the
                tenant provides notice of termination of the rental agreement
                pursuant to Section 5-12-110(g), return to the tenant the
                security deposit
              </span>{' '}
              or any balance thereof and the required interest thereon;
              provided, however, that the landlord, or successor landlord, may
              deduct from such security deposit or interest due thereon for the
              following: (1) Any unpaid rent which has not been validly withheld
              or deducted pursuant to state or federal law or ordinance; (2) A
              reasonable amount necessary to repair any damage caused to the
              premises by the tenant or any person under the tenant's control or
              on the premises with the tenant's consent, reasonable wear and
              tear excluded. In case of such damage, the landlord shall deliver
              or mail to the last known address of the tenant within 30 days an
              itemized statement of the damages allegedly caused to the premises
              and the estimated or actual cost for repairing or replacing each
              item on that statement, attaching copies of the paid receipts for
              the repair or replacement. If estimated cost is given, the
              landlord shall furnish the tenant with copies of paid receipts or
              a certification of actual costs of repairs of damage if the work
              was performed by the landlord's employees within 30 days from the
              date the statement showing estimated cost was furnished to the
              tenant. (e){' '}
              <span>
                In the event of a sale, lease, transfer of ownership or control
                or other direct or indirect disposition of residential real
                property by a landlord who has received a security deposit or
                prepaid rent from a tenant, the successor landlord of such
                property shall be liable to that tenant{' '}
              </span>
              for any security deposit, including statutory interest, or prepaid
              rent which the tenant has paid to the transferor. The successor
              landlord shall, within 14 days from the date of such transfer,
              notify the tenant who made such security deposit by delivering or
              mailing to the tenant's last known address that such security
              deposit was transferred to the successor landlord and that the
              successor landlord and that the successor landlord is holding said
              security deposit. Such notice shall also contain the successor
              landlord's name, business address, and business telephone number
              of the successor landlord's agent, if any. The notice shall be in
              writing.

            <p>
              <span>
                The transferor shall remain jointly and severally liable
              </span>{' '}
              with the successor landlord to the tenant for such security
              deposit or prepaid rent, unless and until such transferor
              transfers said security deposit or prepaid rent to the successor
              landlord and provides notice, in writing, to the tenant of such
              transfer of said security deposit or prepaid rent, specifying the
              name, business address and business telephone number of the
              successor landlord or his agent within ten days of said transfer.
              (f)(1) Subject to subsection (f)(2), if the landlord fails to
              comply with any provision of Section 5-12-080(a)--(e), the tenant
              shall be awarded damages in an amount equal to two times the
              security deposit plus interest at a rate determined in accordance
              with Section 5-12-081. This subsection does not preclude the
              tenant from recovering other damages to which he may be entitled
              under this chapter 5-12-081. (2) If a landlord pays the interest
              on a security deposit or prepaid rent within the 30-day period
              provided for in subsection (c), or within the 45-day period
              provided for in subsection (d), whichever is applicable, but the
              amount of interest is deficient, the landlord shall not be liable
              for damages under subsection (f)(2) unless: a) the tenant gives
              written notice to the landlord that the amount of the interest
              returned was deficient; and b) within fourteen days of the receipt
              of the notice, the landlord fails to either: i) pay to the tenant
              the correct amount of interest due plus $50.00; or (ii) provide to
              the tenant a written response which sets forth an explanation of
              how the interest paid was calculated. If the tenant disagrees with
              the calculation of the interest, as set forth in the written
              response, the tenant may bring a cause of action in a court of
              competent jurisdiction challenging the correctness of the written
              response.{' '}
              <span>
                If the court determines that the interest calculation was not
                accurate, the tenant shall be awarded damages in an amount equal
                to two times the security deposit plus interest at a rate
                determined in accordance with Section 5-12-081.
